## Credit
Huge shoutout to [perikiyoxd](https://github.com/perikiyoxd), they helped me figure out a much better approach by utilizing `_Process(double delta)` for accumulating resources per their respective rates. If it wasn't for them I would still be using Godot timers going down a very different unneedingly complex path.
